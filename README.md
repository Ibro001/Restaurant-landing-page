# Gericht Restaurant Landing Page
This beautiful project is an exquisite work of art build with the client in mind, Gericht restaurant makes it's user feel welcome and comfortable even before scheduling an actual visit to the restaurant!

In this project i took a figma design design and turned it into a beautiful and responsive website, using react
to write beautiful, clean code and well structured files as well as reusable components and CSS to style and place 
the well crafted designs in their respective position.

React.js was utilized for this project due to it high performance when it come's to building responsive website and
web based applications.
CSS was used to styled the app using the Block Element Method (BEM) approach because it helps developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS  in a given project as well as it help developers write clean, well organized and maintainable CSS and speeds up the development process.
For the icons, the react-icon library icons were used as they have a low build size.
